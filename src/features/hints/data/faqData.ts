    question: "What's going on?",
    answer:
      "Somewhere nearby is a magical palace full of puzzles and strange creatures. To move around and interact with the world, you type simple commands at the prompt. Your experiences may be intriguing or puzzling. Talk about them with fellow adventurers, but do not give anything away to those who may be following.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I give instructions?",
    answer:
      "In general, you should type your instructions using two words - for example 'get cube', 'go north', 'use key'. There are some abbreviations though: you can type 'look' to have a general look around, and you can type 'n' for 'go north', 'e' for 'go east' etc. In addition, 'inv' will reveal your inventory. The most common commands are 'get', 'drop', 'use', but there are several others that will be useful, so don't be afraid to try things out!",
  },
  {
    question: "I can't solve this problem - what should I do?",
    answer:
      "If you're stuck, take a step back and look carefully around you - occasionally there will be a clue hidden nearby. Try different ideas and don't be afraid to experiment; thinking like a mathematician means exploring and learning from mistakes. But sometimes, just leaving a puzzle and returning to it later is the right way forward.",

  {
    question: "Help! A Drogo guard is looking at me!",
    answer:
      "Drogos are fairly fearsome creatures that wander the palace, but they do have one weakness - each has a secret number that they cannot bear to hear...",

  {
    question: "What's the difference between classic and modern mode?",
    answer:
      "The only difference is that modern mode has a map included, which makes life considerably easier you. If you have time to spare (and are so inclined), I'd recommend playing the game in classic mode (but I'd also add that you will almost certainly need to make your own map in this case!",
